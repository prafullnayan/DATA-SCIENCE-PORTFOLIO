# DATA-SCIENCE-PORTFOLIO

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and  markdown files.

## TABLE OF CONTENTS

1. **ML Micro Project**
    1. [KNN classifier](https://github.com/prafullnayan/DATA-SCIENCE-PORTFOLIO/tree/master/ML%20Micro%20Projects)
        * K Nearest Neighbour is used to predict the class of unknown test variable by finding the best value of **k**.
    2. [Kingcounty House Price prediction](https://github.com/prafullnayan/DATA-SCIENCE-PORTFOLIO/blob/master/ML%20Micro%20Projects/kingcounty_houseprice%20prediction%20by%20neural%20network.ipynb)    
        * The dataset is collected from kaggle site .In this project **Exploratory Data Analysis** is done and prediction of house price prediction is done on unknown dataset.
        * To predict the price i have used neural network.
    3. [Cancer Classification](https://github.com/prafullnayan/DATA-SCIENCE-PORTFOLIO/blob/master/ML%20Micro%20Projects/cancer_classification.ipynb)
        * By using neural network cancer prediction is done with 0.99 accuracy
        * Exploratory Data Analysis is also done. 
2. **Deep Learning Projects**
     1. [LenderClub Loan Prediction](https://github.com/prafullnayan/DATA-SCIENCE-PORTFOLIO/blob/master/LenderClub_Loan_prediction.ipynb)
        * Dataset is collected from Kaggle.
        * We have to build a model to predict whether the LenderClub company should give the loans to their customer or not.
        * I have used ANN to build the model.
        * Data Wrangling,Data Cleaning,EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis),Feature Engineering,Data Preprocessing,Model Creation,Model Evaluation is well explained.
        * Hyperparameter Tuning is also done to better fit the parameter.
        * Lastly i have used **Tensorboard** library to better visualize the model by looking at the image,graphs,projections,histograms and so many other things.
