# DATA-SCIENCE-PORTFOLIO

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and  markdown files.

## TABLE OF CONTENTS

1. **ML  Project**
    1.  [Airplane Accidents](https://github.com/prafullnayan/DATA-SCIENCE-PORTFOLIO/blob/master/AirplaneAccident.ipynb)
        * Data set is collected from Kaggle.
        * We have to predict airplan accident Severity base on different features.
        * Severity is of four types,so it's a multiclass classification problem.
        * Data Wrangling,Data Cleaning,EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis),Feature Engineering,Data Preprocessing,Model Creation,Model Evaluation is Done.
        * Hyperparameter tuning(both Grid SearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV) is done for tuning the model.
        * Different ML Algorithms uesd for classifying like KNN,SVM,RandomForest Classifier,Logistic Regression and their accuracy is compared.
        
    2. [Kingcounty House Price prediction](https://github.com/prafullnayan/DATA-SCIENCE-PORTFOLIO/blob/master/ML%20Micro%20Projects/kingcounty_houseprice%20prediction%20by%20neural%20network.ipynb)    
        * The dataset is collected from kaggle site .In this project **Exploratory Data Analysis** is done and prediction of house price prediction is done on unknown dataset.
        * To predict the price i have used neural network.
    3. [Cancer Classification](https://github.com/prafullnayan/DATA-SCIENCE-PORTFOLIO/blob/master/ML%20Micro%20Projects/cancer_classification.ipynb)
        * By using neural network cancer prediction is done with 0.99 accuracy
        * Exploratory Data Analysis is also done.   
2. **Deep Learning Projects**
     1. [LenderClub Loan Prediction](https://github.com/prafullnayan/DATA-SCIENCE-PORTFOLIO/blob/master/Deep%20Learning%20Projects/LenderClub_Loan_prediction.ipynb)
        * Dataset is collected from Kaggle.
        * We have to build a model to predict whether the LenderClub company should give the loans to their customer or not.
        * I have used ANN to build the model.
        * Data Wrangling,Data Cleaning,EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis),Feature Engineering,Data Preprocessing,Model Creation,Model Evaluation is well explained.
        * Hyperparameter Tuning is also done to better fit the parameter.
        * Lastly i have used **Tensorboard** library to better visualize the model by looking at the image,graphs,projections,histograms and so many other things. 
3. **Data Analysis and Visualization** 
      1. [India Air Quality Index](https://github.com/prafullnayan/DATA-SCIENCE-PORTFOLIO/blob/master/India%20Air%20Quality%20(Project).ipynb)
         * The visualization was actually a work of my intership to a company named Thw Shaadi Times.
         * The data is combined(across the years and states) and largely clean version of the Historical Daily Ambient Air Quality Data released by the Ministry of Environment              and Forests and Central Pollution Control Board of India under the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP) year 2016-2020
         * To do data analysis on India Air Quality data by viewing concentration of sulphur dioxide,nitrogen dioxide, respirable suspended particualte matter, suspended                    particulate matter and classify the Air Quality as good, moderate, poor, unhealthy, healthy.
         * Data Wrangling,Data Cleaning,EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis),Feature Engineering,Data Preprocessing,Model Creation,Model Evaluation is well explained.
         * Various Machine Learning Models are built and compared with each other with the help of evaluation metrics.
